## what you need to do

Your job is to make sure this repo (https://github.com/palladius/my-sessions-and-bio) is up to date and aligned to
my public speaking job.

When invoked, make sure to search the internet for any resources pointing to my public speaking (eg googling "Riccardo Carlesso talk"), and:

1. Update the README with more/up to date links.
2. Add emojis for videos / talks (üó£Ô∏è) / other as you see fit.
3. Medium scraping: see below
4. Ruby scraping: see below


Try to be minimalistic - NO UPDATE is a lot better than 100 updates. Ideally I should invoke you once a week and you should have ZERO updates most of the times unless some new article comes up.


## Medium scraping

Check for these two pages and make sure my medium article in the README are current:

* Medium ([main page](https://medium.com/@palladiusbonton/)
* [RSS feed](https://medium.com/feed/@palladiusbonton))

## ruby scraping

If what you see is part of Ruby / rails activity, make sure it appears here: https://www.rubyevents.org/speakers/riccardo-carlesso
