## what you need to do

Your job is to make sure this repo (https://github.com/palladius/my-sessions-and-bio) is up to date and aligned to
my public speaking job.

When invoked, make sure to search the internet for any resources pointing to my public speaking (eg googling "Riccardo Carlesso talk"), and:

1. Update the README with more/up to date links.
2. Add emojis for videos / talks (🗣️) / other as you see fit. Also add country emojis beside any european city (Amsterdam -> Netherlands, Pescara -> italy, and so on).
3. **Medium** scraping: see below
4. **Ruby** scraping: see below
5. **Blog** scraping: see below


Try to be minimalistic - NO UPDATE is a lot better than 100 updates. Ideally I should invoke you once a week and you should have ZERO updates most of the times unless some new article comes up.


## Medium scraping

Check for these two pages and make sure my medium article in the README are current:

* Medium ([main page](https://medium.com/@palladiusbonton/)
* [RSS feed](https://medium.com/feed/@palladiusbonton))

## ruby scraping

If what you see is part of Ruby / rails activity, make sure it appears here: https://www.rubyevents.org/speakers/riccardo-carlesso

## Blog scraping

When scraping my blog (https://ricc.rocks/) make sure to only extract work-related article, like Google Cloud or Gemini article. Not articles on food, sport or family.

## ERRORS

Based on previous mistakes Note:

1. I've never talked in Bol, Croatia. The closest I've been is in Euruko in Sarajevo in 2024.
2. I've never been to Antwerp, never been to a fullstackeurope 2024.

I might be missing more of your mistakes, hence see the following part.

## Before you propose to commit, lets review

1. **IMPORTANT** Before you propose to add a change, please confirm with user: "do you confirm you've been to PLACE on MONTH/YEAR with talk on TOPIC"?
1. Keep a `CHANGELOG.md` with date and version up to date.
1. Explain your reasoning when adding new resources.
1. The changelog needs to be explicit about talks/events added, it needs to contain a (YYYY-MM, Location , Topic) line for every talk/event added. This is to make absoultely sure you don't add FALSE events.
1. The git message should have a trailing signature like " -- Created by ♊ gemini-cli" people need to know it's your merit!
Once confirmed, you can git commit and push.
