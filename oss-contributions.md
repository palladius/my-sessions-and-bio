## LangchainRB + Assistant

I recently started contributing to [Langchain.rb](https://github.com/andreibondarev/langchainrb) to add Vertex AI Support.

Some PRs (drafted by me, perfected by good @andreibondarev):

1. First grasp at Vertex AI: https://github.com/andreibondarev/langchainrb/pull/398
2. Adding `summarize()` and `complete()`: https://github.com/andreibondarev/langchainrb/pull/406

Also contributed to the OpenAI-only Assistant and spawned a Gemini version here:
