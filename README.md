## Areas of expertise

I've been in Operations for 20 years #as a Network Engineer (working in NOC).
In Google I specialize on:

* SRE (Site reliability Engineering)
* How Google does Software Development, Culture, Teams, Operations.
* GenAI (new!)
* Ruby
* Pulumi
* GCP foundations (Infra: GCE, "landing zones") and all the experience I matured in 7 years of Professional Services with big customers in DACH.

Code proficiency:

5. (AWESOME) Bash
4. (GOOD) **Ruby**
3. (AVERAGE) `Python`, `Pulumi` (with Python because.. https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/132)
2. (LOW) C, C++, Java, Go, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Terraform
1. (BAD) Javascript/Typescript. I dream of a world where you can choose your own FE language and not stick to ****script.
